  "articleBody": " Client Spring Technologies Product Description The Nulock is a IoT based smart lock which is designed to used on a petrol tanker vehicle. The lock only opens in the area where the tanks refill or empty. It has a geo-fencing feature so lock only opes in the specific area which is set by the admin. It helps to illegally stealing petrol from the tanker when its traveling. The product is design to comply intrinsic safety standards given by the Petroleum \u0026 Explosives Safety Organization (PESO).\nThe Nulock has two variants\nKey and Lock System Fixed lock System Working of Key Lock System This system uses three devices; Mobile app, key and lock. An Andriod app is used to create the task (Access pass) for opening or locking the lock. The task contains the parameters like date \u0026 time slot for opening the lock, lock id, access code, area code etc. The admin create the task when tank comes in the refilling area(Depo). It uses mobile GPS signal to detect if the tanker is in the refilling area. Parallelly, the admin creates a task for opening the lock in unloading area(In the petrol pump station). An OTP is generated for the unloading task.\nAfter creating the task,app checks all the parameters and load the task into the key using the bluetooth connectivity. Once the key is loaded with the task then the user carry the key in the hazardous zone (refilling area). It is not permissable to carry the mobile phone in the hazardous zone because of the chances of the explosion due to cell phone signals.\nThe key is designed/certified to work in a hazardous environment. It has all the protection features to prevent any spark/ignition in the key/lock that can cause an explosion. The key has a small lead acid battery which powers the key and lock. No battery is used in the lock. Each lock has its unique lock id . When the user insert the preloaded task key in the lock then it communicates with the lock’s controller and verify if its the correct lock. After successful verification it opens the lock. The same key can be used to open multiple lock with different lock id.\nWhen the tanker reach at the petrol pump then the user enter the OTP generated by the admin for opening the lock. after entering the OTP in the app, The app verify if its a valid OTP, valid location using the GPS co-coordinate and if its a correct date and time slot. After successful verification the task is loaded into the key and the key is used to open the lock.\nA special protocol is implement to transfer power and data using only two wires from the key to lock. Bluetooth BLE mode is used to transfer the data from mobile to key.\nWorking of Fixed lock model This model uses a non breakable lock which is permanently fitted on the tanker. No mobile device or key is used for the locking/unlocking operation. A dedicated main controller is installed in the tanker which is connected to the lock through a wired connection. The main controller device has inbuilt GPS to track the location and GSM for communication with the server. The task creating process is same as the above process. An app is used to create the task which will then synchronize with the main controller via the internet. Admin has to create a task and OTP to open the lock.\nThe controlling device has a keypad and display which used to enter the OTP and check the current status of the process. One controller can be connected to the multiple locks using a RS485 protocol. The locks are installed on the multiple outlet valves of the tanker. The controller and lock are designed to comply the intrinsic safety guideline.\nMain Controller\nLock Installed on Petrol Tanker\nDemo of Key Lock Model Demo of Fixed Lock Model ",
